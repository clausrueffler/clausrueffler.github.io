### 2024

* New paper co-authored by Claus published in PNAS: *[Central place foragers, prey depletion halos, and how behavioral niche partitioning promotes consumer coexistence](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2411780121)*.

* Welcome to *Olle Wickman* who joins us for his master's thesis. Olle is interested in the role of behavioral habitat choice for species coexistence. He will investigate this question with a combination of analytical and simulation approaches.

* Welcome to *Mattias Finndin* who joins us for his master's thesis. Mattias is interested communities of arctic wader birds and will collect and analyses field observations to understand the role of palsa mires for wader communities.

* New preprint co-authored by *Claus*: *[Central place foragers, prey depletion halos, and how behavioral niche partitioning promotes consumer coexistence](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.06.13.598783v1)*.

* A big congratulations to *Mattias* for successfully defending his PhD thesis *[Mathematical Solutions to Divergent Evolution](https://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:uu:diva-526967)* on 14 June. Many thanks go to *[Eva Kisdi (University of Helsinki, Finland)](https://www.mv.helsinki.fi/home/kisdi/)* for acting as faculty opponent. Eva and Mattias had the most interesting discussion one could hope for at a PhD defense.

### 2023

* *Claus* gives a talk in the *[Theoretical Ecology Webinar Series](https://iite.info/seminar/)* organized by the *[International Initiative for Theoretical Ecology](https://iite.info/)*. In his talk, he presents work by Marco and Paula on evolutionary diversification and community assembly for species with complex life cycles. You can see a recording of his presentation *[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trPw2meV6DY)*.

* New paper co-authored by *Mattias* published in The American Naturalist: *[Anisogamy does not always promote the evolution of mating competition traits in males](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/727968)*.

* Welcome to *Izabel Eriksson Reuterborg* who joins us for her master's thesis. Izabel studies at Uppsala University. She is interested in modelling community assembly in consumer species with complex life cycles. To this end, she will get into writing individual-based simulations in R.

* New paper co-authored by *Claus* published in The American Naturalist: *[Resource variation within and between patches: Where exploitation competition, local adaptation and kin selection meet](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/727483)*.

* New paper by *Marco*, *Paula* and *Claus* published in Ecology Letters:
*[Complex life cycles drive community assembly through immigration and adaptive diversification](
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.14216)*.

### 2022

* A big congratulations to *Paula* for successfully defending her PhD thesis *[Adaptive evolution in multidimensional trait spaces](https://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1686131&dswid=6054)* on 23 September. Many thanks go to *[Maria Servedio (University of North Carolina, USA)](https://bio.unc.edu/faculty-profile/servedio/)* for acting as faculty opponent.

* Welcome to *Iris van Engen* who joint us for her research training. Iris is an exchange student visting us from the University of Lausanne. She is interested in how trophic cascades due to top-predators can affect diversification and coexistence of consumers at an intermediate trophic level.

### 2021
