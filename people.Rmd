### Claus Rüffler (PI)

My name is properly spelled with the German letter "ü". However, in my scientific publications I use the letter combination "ue" instead.

### Olle Wickman (master's student, 2024-25)
::: {.floatting}

In his master's thesis, Olle build and analyzed mathematical models to investigate the role of behavioral habitat choice for species coexistence.
:::

### Mattias Finndin (master's student, 2024-25)
::: {.floatting}

In his master's thesis, Mattias analyzed a large set of bird inventory data from Torne Lappmark, Northern Sweden, to investigate the role of palsa mires for communities of arctic wader birds. 
:::

### [Mattias Siljestam](https://www.su.se/english/profiles/masi4191-1.759284) (PhD student, defended 2024)
::: {.floatting}

Mattias mainly worked on models investigating the emergence of polymorphism at diploid loci, using *Adaptive dynamics in allele space*. In his models, polymorphism can often be understood as division of labor between two different alleles at the same locus.

### Izabel Eriksson Reuterborg (master's student, 2023-24)
::: {.floatting}

In her master's thesis, Izabel investigated by means of individual-based computer simulations how complex life cycles affect community assembly.
:::

### [Marco Saltini](https://research.wur.nl/en/persons/marco-saltini) (posdoc, 2020-22)

::: {.floatting}

Marco joined us as a Thunberg Fellow at the Swedish Collegium of Advanced Study (SCAS). He investigated how complex life cycles and ontogentic niche shifts affect adaptive radiations and community assembly. He continued as a postdoc at Wageningen University.
:::

### [Paula Vasconcelos](https://paulavasconcelos.net/) (PhD student, defended 2022)
::: {.floatting}

Paula joined us all the way from Brazil for her PhD on evolutionary dynamics in multi-dimensional trait spaces. She successfully defended her PhD-thesis in September 2022 and then started working as a data scientist.
:::

### Iris van Engen (bachelor student, 2022)
::: {.floatting}

Iris was an exchange student visiting us from the University of Lausanne. During her research training she investigated how trophic cascades due to the presence of a top-predator affect diversification and coexistence of consumers at an intermediate trophic level. She continued with a master's in Environment Biology at
University of Utrecht.

### Alexandros Bantounas (master's student, 2020-21)
::: {.floatting}

In his master's thesis, Alexandros investigated how reproductive interference can affect the distribution of different hosts in a spatially structured plant-host-parasitoid system. He continued as a PhD student in the evolutionary ecology group at the University of Antwerp.

### [Gil Henriques](https://gilhenriques.github.io/) (master's student, 2015)

Gil's master's thesis in 2015 was jointly supervised by Simone Immler and Claus.
