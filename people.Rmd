### Claus Rüffler (PI)

My name is properly spelled with the German letter "ü". However, in my scientific publications I use the letter combination "ue" instead.

[Profile at Uppsala University](https://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N14-1246)  

Mattias is interested in the evolution of population level polymorphism that can be interpreted as division of labor.

## Alumni

### [Paula Vasconcelos](https://paulavasconcelos.net/) (PhD student)
::: {.floatting}

Paula joined us all the way from Brazil for her PhD on evolutionary dynamics in multi-dimensional trait spaces. She successfully defended her PhD-thesis in September 2022 and then started working as a data scientist.

### [Marco Saltini](https://research.wur.nl/en/persons/marco-saltini) (posdoc, 2020-22)

::: {.floatting}

Marco joined us as a Thunberg Fellow at the Swedish Collegium of Advanced Study (SCAS). He investigated how complex life cycles and ontogentic niche shifts affect adaptive radiations and community assembly. He continued as a postdoc at Wageningen University.

### Iris van Engen (bachelor student, 2022)
::: {.floatting}

Iris was an exchange student visting us from the University of Lausanne. During her research training she investigated how trophic cascades due to the presence of a top-predator affect diversification and coexistence of consumers at an intermediate trophic level. She continued with a master's in Environment Biology at
University of Utrecht.

### [Alexandros Bantounas](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/staff/alexandros-bantounas_23478/) (master's student, 2020-21)
::: {.floatting}

In his master's thesis Alexandros investigated how reproductive interference can affect the distribution of different hosts in a spatially structured plant-host-parasitoid system. He continued as a PhD student in the evolutionary ecology group at the University of Antwerp.

### [Gil Henriques](https://gilhenriques.github.io/) (master's student, 2015)

Gil's master's thesis in 2015 was jointly supervised by Simone Immler and Claus.
